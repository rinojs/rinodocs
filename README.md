# Rino Docs 🦏

Documentation tool with Rino! This tool will automatically turn your markdown files into web pages. It will generate list of page links in the sidebar. And you can also edit the page and component files to build a very unique document website.

## ▶️ Installation & Commands

The recommended way to start your documentation project:

```
npm create rinodocs@latest
```

Build web pages from markdown in `./src/mds`:

```
npm run dev
```

Build sitemap:

```
npm run sitemap
```

## 📢 Notice

Make sure you setup domain and name of site for dev.js and sitemap.js.

Please use number on name of your markdown files. Then you can list them in the order that you want.
Markdown file name example:

```
1. somemd1.md
2. somemd2.md
3. somemd2.md
```

Then output will be:

```
somemd1.md
somemd2.md
somemd2.md
```
